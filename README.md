The Problem Every Google Workspace Admin Faces

Managing Google Workspace is complex, time-consuming, and error-prone. Whether you're auditing user access, tracking license usage, managing shared drives, or monitoring security alerts, these tasks require hours of manual work, deep technical knowledge, and constant attention. One missed permission or overlooked inactive account can create security risks or unnecessary costs.

--The Solution: Companion app to GAM / Google Workspace
